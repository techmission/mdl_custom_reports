2. the papers are too long in regards to the topic, writing a 10 page paper on a topic that requires no more than 2 pages makes the assignment difficult in a non productive way.

3. I would suggest grading the assignments more often as its week 8 and i have yet to receive any grades, this makes it very hard to succeed and know if you are doing the assignments right.

4. don't give a 10 page paper during the mid term week, we have more then one class to study for and this type of assignment makes it impossible for us to do well as it eats our time.


5. communicate with the students more, this is not just a problem with this class but all my classes I feel that the instructors don't want to be here.

Assignments this long with the execption of final or midterm projects make students more concerned with how to write more rather than share what they actually learned. I think 5 pages should be the max for any assignment unless it is a mid term or final project. I don't see any good reason to have an assignment more than 5 pages unless  you are doing it for accredidation purposes.

       I would have liked my homework graded as I went along the course simply because I need to know where I needed to improve before doing the next assignment.  
       I learned so much! I thought I cooked in a safe manner all of these years and stored food properly. Not true! I volunteered in the kitchen at the rescue mission while taking this course. For one reason, I'm a visual learner and can remember what I've learned better if I SEE it all in action.  Learning about nutrition was very good also. I put the "5 a-day" (2 fruits and 3 vegetables) suggestion into practice for myself. It didn't take long for me to feel a lot better. By putting this into practice, I know from first hand experience, how much better, people who eat at the mission will feel when getting good nutrition. 
      I appreciated that nutrition for children was a separate study from adults. I would have liked portion sizes to be more clearly stated in our homework. It would have been great to have healthy snack suggestions for kids included in the course too. 
      I learned a lot more than I expected to. It is all useful information. Suzi

An open-door policy would be very helpful for students to get clarity of some of the assignments. I found myself struggling with a couple of questions, and wanted to talk to the instructor. Emailing is ok, but sometimes you need a voice on the line. I found the material in this course very interesting, and It has already been helpful for our ministry. Thank you for choosing the right material. I just spoke with a professional fundraiser who read my course study book buy the author, Stanley Weinstein.

However, I do wish that there was another route for students to asses the lessons from the curriculum if they for whatever reason are unable to gain access to the necessary people or files within their organization. 

I appreciate the high-regard "hands-on learning" is afforded, however I wish other avenues where further explored that would allow students such as myself an opportunity to still learn about the inner-workings of a nonprofit even if their organization does not value their interns and their education.

Again, overall the professor was very understanding of the various extenuating circumstances and the intentions were good.

            [Survey_Q1__c] => This was my first online class ever and my first college class in decades so I had certain expectations that maybe were unrealistic maybe not. My first expectation was that there would be much better interaction with the professor and that the professor would actually teach the class each week on the subject of the week. What we got was a recording from a net institute symposium from a couple of years ago. The first guy that we watched spent much of his time interacting with the class that was there and we couldn't even hear what they were saying. The second lady talked about subjects that we had already studied a couple of weeks ago. I had expected timely grading of my papers but what I got was papers graded several weeks after they were due. We had study guides to fill out and turn in but once graded I could only see the grade but not see what questions that I missed. When papers were graded, the feedback never really gave me any reason why it was only given a b-. I would like to know these things in order to improve on the next assignment, however if papers aren't being graded for weeks after they are turned in that information is useless. Not only was the instructor slow in grading but he was very slow in responding to questions via e-mail or via chat room. I sent questions via e-mail and chat room that were never answered. Since this is my first online class, maybe my expectations were too high. All I know is that if this is the way that online classes operate, I am unimpressed.

            [Survey_Q1__c] => The materials presented on our course home page needs to be narrowed down to what we will use in this class. Supplemental material is okay. But having so many links to the same material and those links are broken or of not good quality is a great disappointment. I was trying to watch Jean's video and it was disappointing to see how terrible this video was.

Also, there needs to be a better way of supplying the correct course materials. Several times, when I had to view video's along with it's accompanying material, either I didn't know which page the speaker was on or not sure what material he/she was using. I downloaded all the worksheets but it was confusing at times trying to figure out which ones I was suppose to use. Seems like some of these pages are all jumbled together. Some have page formatting that is different--where you have to turn your head to the side to view.

It would be nice if our study guide worksheet questions were in chronological order per each chapter section we are working on. To be honest, it's an inconvenience to be working on the beginning questions of chapter XXX, and then the next question answer is located at the very end of that chapter. That meaning, I have to stop where I'm at and go all the way down to another part of the materiel to locate, read, and   answer this question. Then make my way back to where I left off at the earlier set of questions.

Last, if course materials and videos are going to be posted on the actual home work description page...please make sure the links are not broken. I would rather see just the assignment description alone, than having to go back to the course home page to get the material, and then click back on the assignment page. Ideally, it would be nice to have access to the links on the homework page if possible.

My only concern with this class, was regarding, posting our grades in a timely fashion. Most professors post grades within 2 or 3 days of getting our uploaded assignments’. I understand that some professors are adjunct professors and have other jobs. But if a question is misunderstood and not answered correctly, at least if our assignments were graded on time, the student would see the mistake and not duplicate the inaccurate answer on the test.

Lynda Mitton was always extremely helpful when I needed it and answered my questions in a timely manner. I learned so much and am grateful for the time I have spent taking this Addiction Dynamics course. I spent well beyond the 10 - 12 hours a week I anticipated before the class began, as I read somewhere in the literature! You get out of something what you put into it. So I did. The information I was exposed to and the bits and pieces I have retained and the pages of notes I have taken will be helpful in the position God has placed me. If I had to point to 2 specific things I gleaned the most from it would have been the Faith Factor  videos and the book, Living from the Heart Jesus Gave You. Overall the course is well put together and very beneficial. The one thing that was annoying was the when watching the videos they would just stop and some were mislabeled so a few times it was confusing. But it certainly is not a deal breaker. I would whole heartedly recommend this course and City Vision College.

I wish the issue of the Sunday Midnight cutoff could be changed to a Saturday or even Friday. I hope I am not alone in feeling Sunday is for Church. Since more than a few have prayer, bible study, service, and sometimes evening prayer service, it was very difficult sometimes to choose between coursework and Sunday service. 

I like the Class Forum idea. I do not like that there is not much challenging to ideals. There were a lot of shocked Christians with the class presentations. I'm sure there will be more than one of each class that will not accept the transitional changes this course took us through as Christians. At least, that was how I felt by some of the blogs I read. Too bad this class is not a requirement for many pastors prior to ordination. Especially those that do not require seminary graduation in order to be ordained.

I feel that this situation resulted in me loosing marks through no fault of my own, which is particularly distressing considering I worked so hard on this course. I purchased the editions of the books I was told to buy when registering for the course, however the content only lines up around 75% of the time. I think the chapter assignments need to be updated so that they line up with the course literature, playing particular attention to questions that ask for statistics that are simply not in the literature.

Copy of Email to Rachel:
[Course 413 has been a constant struggle regarding page numbers and material.  I know it will not benefit the current class but for future students, it needs to be updated.  I have done worse in this class than any thus far while at CV...the inconsistency of assignments vs not only where it is in the book but what to look for in a different book (Example: the assignment read: "Use the chart on page 90 to..." but there isn't one on page 90.  Having an identification like "The Addiction and Recovery Chart shown on Page 90" would have allowed us to find it.  And the chapters are different so including the name of the chapter instead of just Chapter 1 would have been so useful!)]

2. Maybe giving more feedback on assignments.  Ex: I received a B- on my study guide but I'm not sure which ones I missed.  Ex:  I received a B- on an interview paper and I'm not sure why and therefore don't know what I need improvement on.

The assignments are hard to complete if you have no affiliations with a ministry. If there was one assignment that required one interview that’s different; but every assignment required interviewing a director or board member--not very practical for students not volunteering or working in a nonprofit.  Also, this professor never responded to emails. I don’t understand this. This seems to be City Vision’s theme. It seems you ‘all don’t care enough about your students to reach out if there is a problem or question. Online students need support, since we can’t talk to or see our professors or management face-to-face.

Also this survey should be structured to reveal what students are really experiencing at City Vision. I only signed up for this school because it is supposedly a christian college and that, it offered drug abuse recovery and inner city mission courses. Yet, it lacks fundamental support, issues with financial aid, professors who grade papers late (which tells me they don't care about the students), professors, deans, and other management that won't reply to emails or phone calls. Honestly, I could not recommend anyone to take classes at City Vision.  I could say more but I will stop here.

Obviously this isn't a big deal if it stays the same, I just found that it got a little confusing having soo many tabs and not only that, a little overwhelming because it looked like a lot more work than what was required (because there were so many listed).

Her job as a professor is her only job (besides being a mom of 3) so she has more time to pour into her students, which I believe is VITAL in providing a good education.

I felt like I was able to develop some new skills that I am actually able to apply to working in the field of recovery.  I also learned a lot about myself and was challenged to work harder on some areas of professional development.  I am grateful to have been able to gain this insight from taking this class.  It wasn't too easy or unable to understand but rather a very good balance.  I feel I developed and enhanced skills that I will be able to utilize and apply in my career in the future.  I am blessed to have been given so much from this class.
Thank you.

I did not feel the final instructor's feedback enhanced my learning or directed my incorrect interpretations other than theologic comments. The format of lack of knowing my answers were incorrect or papers written were in line or grading prompt was frustrating. Making a mistake in healthcare means a sentinal event and hospitalization may occur. With an ethical error it could mean a suicide. Zero feedback and terrible organization of reading materials to study guides left me wondering about continuing studying. 
Is group study allowed? I still believe answers to study guides because of subjective cultural should be ask as according to text that has reasonable answers to major concerns of concepts. Horrible experience if I was naïve to life and dealing with patients.

The main suggestion I have has to do with clarity. When enrolling in the class I was under the belief that it was a shortened six week course. Under this impression I set up my work schedule accordingly. At the end of week six I looked and realized there were assignments listed for weeks seven and eight. I was surprised to see a week 7 and 8 and more surprised to see additional assignments. I enjoyed the teaching of this class and wanted to make time for the additional assignments it was just simply not possible in accordance with my prior commitments. This may have been a misunderstanding on my part alone and so I understand any deductions imposed as a result. If this was not a misunderstanding I ask for the sake of future students that this expectation will be clarified. 

Thank you again for presenting such necessary material. This course and the timing in my life have clearly been Gods providence. I look forward to starting my new career with fresh insight and I pray that I will be a good steward of all wisdom imparted to me. I pray that those I serve will truly experience the Joy of the Lord.

            [Survey_Q1__c] => It was very difficult to get a handle on all of the information each week.  It would help if there were a study guide given with each week.  There is so much information it was difficult to prepare for the tests without a weekly study guide.  It was hard to find the "right" answer for the questions on the test study guides especially since some questions were very specific on the test but had more than one answer in the information.
ie: Question 89: The story of Eric Liddell is told in both film and book and illustrates the life of a man who finished well. He died in:
Answer: he died in 1945 in a concentration camp in China.  I only put "in a concentration camp".  I was marked incorrect because the test wants "China".  How could I have known which part of his story was wanted in the test question?
ie: Question #76: The Church is described as both the “Gathered” Life of the Believers and the ______ Life of Believers.  I put dispersed, the correct answer is "scattered". They were used synonymously in many areas of the curriculum.  
The other area of frustration was the lack of communication with the professor.  I had questions along the way that when submitted were unanswered.  The papers were not graded in a timely manner so it was difficult to correct any mistakes being made.
The power point presentations could be printed for the first 6 weeks but not for the last two weeks.  Having those printed while watching the lectures would have helped organize information as well.
In all CVC classes it would help to be able to respond to the comments given with the grades.  My professors were very complimentary each with a few questions for me, I would have liked to have responded to their comments directly.
With the ability to manage the information better and prepare for tests better this would be an excellent class.  I loved the lectures and the books were good information.  I have been in church ministry for 30 years and I was so thankful for the approach to work, the lessons learned, and the way this class touched my heart.

My only regret was reading the book Religion Online, I was so very happy that I did not have to write a review and post it online.  I found it drawn-out and disheartening, not something I would want to gaze upon.  Thank you for a fulfilling experience.
